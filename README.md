<h3 id="1">Assignment 1. Numerical Optimization</h3>

- Problem sets: 2.1, 2.2(a)(d), 2.5.
- **Univariate Optimization**: Newton-Raphson method, Bisection method, Fixed-Point iteration, Secant method.
- **Multivariate Optimization**: Newton-Raphson method, Fisher Scoring, Steepest Ascent method, Quasi-Newton method. 
- My score of this assignment is: **98/100**. I forgot to add Lipschitz Condition, the convergence condition of Fixed-Point iteration, to my report. This mistake has been revised in the latest version.




<h3 id="2">Assignment 2. Combinatorial Optimization</h3>

- Problem sets: 3.1(a), 3.2(a)(b), 3.3(b), 2.1 (requirements: use simulated annealing, select a suitable proposal density function, and define a suitable neighborhood), 3.6(a)(b).
- **Combinatorial Optimization**: Local Search, Simulated Annealing (I love this method so much!), Genetic Algorithm, Tabu Algorithm. 
- My score of this assignment is: **100/100**.




<h3 id="3">Assignment 3. EM Algorithm</h3>

- Problem sets: 4.1(a)(b)(f), 4.2(a)(b)(c).
- **EM Algorithm**: Likelihood function of complete data, Q function, update function in M step. 
- **Improving EM Algorithm**: Monte Carlo EM, ECM, EM Gradient, Aitken Acceleration.
- **Variance Estimation**: Bootstrap, Empirical Information, Louis method.
- My score of this assignment is: **100/100**.




<h3 id="4">Assignment 4. Numerical Integration & Monte Calo Simulation</h3>

- Problem sets: 5.4, 5.5, 6.3(a)(b), 6.5, 6.9(a).
- **Numerical Integration**: Romberg integration, Gaussian Quadrature.
- **Monte Calo Simulation**: Importance sampling, rejection sampling, antithetic sampling, control variates, sequence importance sampling.
- **Variance Estimation**: Bootstrap, Empirical Information, Louis method.
- My score of this assignment is: **98/100**. I forgot to derive the exact value of optimal $\lambda$ in 6.5(b). This mistake has been revised in the latest version.




<h3 id="5">Assignment 5. Bootstrap</h3>

- Problem sets: 9.1, 9.4(a), 9.6.
